In C++, iterators are used to navigate through the elements of a container, such as an array, vector, or list. An iterator is an object that can be used to traverse through the elements of a container and access their values.

There are different types of iterators in C++, but the most commonly used are input iterators, output iterators, and forward iterators.

Input iterators allow you to read the elements of a container in a sequential order, but you cannot modify the elements through an input iterator.

Output iterators allow you to write to the elements of a container, but you cannot read from them.

Forward iterators, on the other hand, allow you to both read and write the elements of a container, and can be used to iterate through the container in a sequential order.

To use an iterator, you first need to obtain an iterator object from the container. You can do this by using the container's begin() and end() functions. The begin() function returns an iterator to the first element of the container, while the end() function returns an iterator to one past the last element of the container.

You can then use the iterator to access the elements of the container by dereferencing the iterator using the * operator, and you can move the iterator to the next element in the container by incrementing it using the ++ operator.

For example, to iterate through the elements of an std::vector<int> container, you can do something like this:

Copy code
std::vector<int> myVector;
// Fill the vector with some values

// Obtain an iterator to the first element of the vector
std::vector<int>::iterator it = myVector.begin();

// Iterate through the vector
while (it != myVector.end()) {
    // Access the current element of the vector
    int value = *it;
    std::cout << value << std::endl;

    // Move the iterator to the next element
    it++;
}
This is the basic usage of iterator in C++ STL, but keep in mind that iterator in c++ is a very powerful tool and it can be used in more complex ways and with different types of container such as associative and unordered container.

I need to re-implement an vector class in C++ but I don't know how to create the iterator. How can I start ? 
To create an iterator for your custom vector class, you will need to define an iterator class that implements the required functionality. Here are the basic steps you can follow to create an iterator for your custom vector class:

Define the iterator class: Create a new class that will represent your iterator. This class should have a constructor that takes a pointer to the underlying data, and should define the operator* and operator++ operators.

Define the begin() and end() functions: Define two functions called begin() and end() that return an iterator to the first and last elements of the vector, respectively.

Define the iterator type: Define a type called iterator that is an alias for the iterator class you just created.

Example of an iterator class for a custom vector:

Copy code
template<typename T>
class MyVector {
  public:
    class iterator {
    public:
        iterator(T* ptr) : m_ptr(ptr) {}
        T& operator*() { return *m_ptr; }
        iterator& operator++() { ++m_ptr; return *this; }
        bool operator!=(const iterator& other) { return m_ptr != other.m_ptr; }
    private:
        T* m_ptr;
    };
    iterator begin() { return iterator(m_data); }
    iterator end() { return iterator(m_data + m_size); }
  private:
    T* m_data;
    size_t m_size;
};
And now you can use your custom vector with the STL algorithm and loops like this:

Copy code
MyVector<int> myvec;
for(auto i:myvec)
    std::cout<<i<<std::endl;
Keep in mind that this is a basic example and you can add more functionality to your iterator, such as const_iterator, reverse_iterator, operator-- etc.
Also it is important to test your iterator class to make sure it works correctly with different types of inputs and use cases.

How can I implement a const_iterator from a vector iterator in c++  ?
You can implement a const_iterator from a vector iterator by defining a class that inherits from vector<T>::iterator and overrides the reference operator (operator*) to return a const reference.

Here's an example:

cpp
Copy code
template <typename T>
class VectorConstIterator : public std::vector<T>::iterator {
 public:
  using base = typename std::vector<T>::iterator;

  VectorConstIterator(base it) : base(it) {}

  const T& operator*() const {
    return base::operator*();
  }
};
You can then use this class to create a const_iterator:

c
Copy code
std::vector<int> v{1, 2, 3};
VectorConstIterator<int> it(v.begin());
const int& i = *it;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONTEXT: with this method, the begin function does not work because it return a iterator and not a const_iterator (the error message is  error: no viable conversion from 'ft::vector<int>::iterator' to 'ft::vector<int>::const_iterator'). 
QUESTION: How can I fix this error ? I would like that the function begin works with both iterators.

To make the begin function work with both iterator and const_iterator, you can provide two begin functions, one returning an iterator and the other returning a const_iterator. You can do this by using a typedef for each type, and then providing two begin functions, each using a different type:

cpp
Copy code
template <typename T>
class Vector {
 public:
  typedef typename std::vector<T>::iterator iterator;
  typedef typename std::vector<T>::const_iterator const_iterator;

  iterator begin() {
    return data_.begin();
  }
  const_iterator begin() const {
    return data_.begin();
  }
  // ...
 private:
  std::vector<T> data_;
};
With this implementation, you can use begin with either an iterator or a const_iterator:

java
Copy code
Vector<int> v;
Vector<int>::iterator it = v.begin();
Vector<int>::const_iterator cit = v.begin();
